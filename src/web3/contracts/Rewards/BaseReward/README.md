## How Base Reward works?
This is literally the base Contract of all the Rewards in Saver Community. Also this Contract handles the Stablecoin Reward in Able.

This Contract has the basic interface that all the Rewards Contracts have to follow. Some functions are virtual, because maybe some Reward requires another logic for his own Reward, but the idea is always the same.
